# Week 1 Introduction

Text is written in Markdown. This is a simple markup language that takes
care of formatting and allows for quick easy formatting.

1.  Sample Title To create a new paragraph, just include a blank line.

**Bold** or *italics* can be done easily. Also can use **bold** or
*italics*. Code can be shown in monospace with backticks `code example`.

## Level 2 Header

Lists are easy:

-   Unordered

-   List

    -   Nested version list
    -   Idea 2

-   Third

### Ordered Lists

Use numbers to create ordered list:

1.  first

2.  second

3.  third

4.  fourth

5.  Create Links Links are easy, two different versions.\

6.  Images are similar ![alt text](https:x.png "UI Logo")

7.  Tables Tables are also simple.

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Text     | Text     |
| Text     | Text     |

6.  Block Quotes Block quotes:

> This is an example of a block quote that is wrapped. The text will be
> indented as a block quote automatically.

7.  Line Break\
    A line break can be made with three or more dashed or asterisks

8.  Dynamic Documents

8.1 Using markdown, R code can be directly embedded into the document.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- runif(100, min = 3, max = 8)
mean(x)
mean(y)
```

8.2 Showing additional code options

-   Do not show syntax

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- runif(100, min = 3, max = 8)
mean(x)
mean(y)
```

-   Do not print results

```{r, results = "hide"}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- runif(100, min = 0, max = 1)
mean(x)
mean(y)
```

-   Automatically include figures

```{r fig, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- runif(100, min = 3, max = 8)
plot(x, y)
```

The `knitr` website has additional chunk options
<http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>. You can even set global options by
doing something like the following:

```{r global_opts, eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

9.  Inline code `knitr` also has the ability to run code inline.
    Therefore, if we wanted to report the correlation between `x` and
    `y` reported above, we can do that.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
a = cor(x,y)
```

For example, the correlation between student test scores (x) and the
student grade (y) is `r round(cor(x, y), 3)`.

Another options is to use inline code linking the r options with an
object created in a previous chunk = `r a`

10. Compile document The easiest way to compile the document is to use
    the "Knit" button in Rstudio. This button will directly compile the
    document into an html file based on the specification of the
    `output` option at the top of this file. Changing the `output`
    options can produce a pdf (`output: pdf_document`) or a word file
    (`output: word_document`).

Another option is to compile the `.Rmd` file with knitr, then use
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to convert it to another option via the
command line. You could also use the `rmarkdown` package in R which will
include both the `knitr` package and the `pandoc` program. More
